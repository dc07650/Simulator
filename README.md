# Simulator
 Simulators for various engineering problems.  
- 2DoF_RodPendulum  
> : Simulator for a 2 DoF rod pendulum considering the mass effects of the rod itself.
- 2DoF_RodPendulum_LockScreen  
> : Simulator for a 2 DoF rod pendulum considering the mass effects of the rod itself. Changed the plot ratio settings for a better view.
- 2DoF_SpringMass  
> : Simulator for a 2 DoF spring mass system. Spring mass is neglected and only the point masses are considered.
- 2Dof3Dof_PointMass_RobotArm  
> : Simulator for a 2 DoF and 3 DoF point mass robotic arm.  
>   IK: Given a proper trajectory and initial condition, the end effector of the robot arm will follow the desired path.  
>   ID: Given a desired force plan that is to be applied to the end effector, the robot will move by the force plan. Gravity can be introduced to the system.  
- Slope_RigidBody  
> : Simulator for a 1 DoF rigid body rolling motion on a slope with a no-slip condition.
